## ‚åõ History of project creation ‚åõ

Creating this project, as it was a team effort, the biggest challenge was synchronizing the team as a cohesive entity. However, this hurdle was successfully overcome thanks to the initiative and resourcefulness of all team members. From a technological standpoint, the most challenging, yet intriguing, aspects were integrating notifications via the Telegram messenger and utilizing the Dropboxdrb box service for storing attachments. Nevertheless, this milestone was also successfully conquered.üí™

## üìà Possible improvements üìà

Overall, we are confident that this project covers all necessary functionality and is sufficiently convenient for integration. However, as always, there is room for growth. First and foremost, shortly, our plans include achieving maximum code coverage with tests, adding the ability to search for projects/tasks by partial name or other fields, as well as expanding the functionality of notifications via Telegram
